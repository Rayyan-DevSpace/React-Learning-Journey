# React-Learning-Journey 🚀

This repository contains my personal React learning journey — from fundamentals to building real, functional components.
I’m exploring core concepts like JSX, components, props, state, hooks, routing, and project structuring.
The goal is to understand how modern React apps are built and how to integrate them with APIs, UI libraries, and real-world workflows.

### What’s inside?

* Basic React concepts with clean examples
* Small practice components
* Experiments with hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
* Notes, mini-projects, and improvements over time

This repo will keep growing as I learn more!
